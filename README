== Documentation

You can also download the Official Manual from the above location,
under each release's download page.

The online documentation (not always up-to-date) is available at

http://gladius.sourceforge.net/docs/

== Usage ==

Gladius DB engine can be used as stand-alone (including gladius.php)
or with ADODB lite ( http://adodblite.sourceforge.net/index.php )
using the supplied driver gladius_driver.inc.

If your databases' folder is not the gladius.php's folder, set the
variable $GLADIUS_DB_ROOT before including gladius.php or calling
ADODB's AdoNewConnection(). Example:

<?php
  
  include 'gladius.php';
  
  $G = new Gladius();
  
  $G->SetDBRoot('path/to/database_directories') or die;
  
  $G->SelectDB('db_directory_or_path_to_db');
  
  $G->Query('CREATE TABLE hypsin ( base FLOAT, root FLOAT)');

?>

The above example will create a table named 'hypsin' with two fields
of type float in the folder 'database_name', which must already exist.
